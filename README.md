# Digital-Assistant-Using-Python

You guys can run the PyDA.py and ask any question to the Digital assistant.
Just make sure to install all the required python packages.
Required packages are:
1. wikipedia
2. wolframalpha
3. wx

Although Speech Recognition part is not completed yet, I'll complete this when i get free time for this.
If any body did further improvements, then do let me know.
